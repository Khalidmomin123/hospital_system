Hospital Management System (HMS)
Overview
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a web-based application built using Java Servlets and JSP for managing various hospital operations. It handles tasks like patient registration, doctor scheduling, billing, and employee management, streamlining administrative processes to improve hospital efficiency and service delivery.

Features
Patient Management: Add, view, update, and delete patient records with detailed personal and medical information.

Appointment Scheduling: Allow patients to book appointments with doctors, and manage doctor availability.

Reports: Generate reports on patient visits, revenue, employee performance, and other key hospital metrics.

User Roles: Different user roles with varying access levels (Admin, Doctor, Patient).

Tech Stack
Backend: Java (Servlets, JSP)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Database: MySQL

Web Server: Apache Tomcat (for deploying Servlets and JSP)

IDE: Eclipse

Installation
Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

Eclipse IDE (with the Java EE plugin)

Apache Tomcat (for deploying Servlets and JSP)

MySQL (or any compatible database)

JDK 8+ (for compiling and running Java)

MySQL JDBC Driver (for database connection)

Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hospital-management-system.git
cd hospital-management-system
Set up the MySQL Database:

Create a new database in MySQL, for example hospital_db.

sql
Copy
CREATE DATABASE hospital_db;
Import the necessary SQL schema (tables) from the provided SQL file in the repository, or manually create tables for patients, employees, appointments, billing, etc.

Configure Database Connection:

Open the project in Eclipse.

Locate the DBConnection.java class (or any class handling the database connection).

Update the database connection URL, username, and password according to your MySQL setup.

java
Copy
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital_db";
String user = "root";
String password = "password";
Deploy the Project in Apache Tomcat:

In Eclipse, go to the Servers tab.

Right-click and select New > Server. Choose Apache Tomcat and the correct version.

Add your project to the server in Eclipse.

Start the server from Eclipse.

Running the Application:

Once the Tomcat server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

text
Copy
http://localhost:8080/hospital-management-system
Access the Application:

Use the provided login page to log in as an admin or other user (based on your role setup).

The Admin user can manage patient records, appointments, billing, etc., while other roles have restricted access.

Database Configuration Example
Here’s an example of the DBConnection.java file for connecting to your MySQL database:

java
Copy
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class DBConnection {
    private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital_db";
    private static final String USER = "root";
    private static final String PASSWORD = "password";
    private static Connection connection = null;

    public static Connection getConnection() {
        if (connection == null) {
            try {
                connection = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, PASSWORD);
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        return connection;
    }
}
